<h2 id="csrf-protection">CSRF Protection</h2>
<p>Note about CSRF protection. This basically prevents hackers
from being able to post to our POST routes without having actually
loaded a form on our website. E.g. they could potentially create
users if they found out the URL for our register routes and
the params we expect (its fairly easy to do). But with
CSRF protection, all forms have a hidden field that is verified on
our end. This is a bit low level, but there is a SESSION object
stored on the flask server in memory. Each user has their
own session containing things like their username, password, etc
When a form created, a random string called a CSRF token is
created and is sent along with the form in a hidden field.
Simultaneously, this string is added to the user session
stored on the server. When the user submits a form, then
the server will check to see if the hidden form field with the
CSRF token matches the CSRF token stored in the user's session
on the server. If it does, then everything is fine and the
POST request can proceed normally. If not, then the POST request
is aborted as a 403 (i think) error is thrown...basically
the user is not able to POST. This is great for forms, but
if you want to create a public API that does not require a session,
then you'll want to include a decorator on your route <code>@csrf.exempt</code></p>
<h2 id="flask-login">Flask-Login</h2>
<pre><code class="python">login_manager = LoginManager()
login_manager.session_protection = 'strong'
login_manager.login_view = 'account.login'
</code></pre>

<p>Flask-login provides us with a bunch of easy ways to do secure and
simple login techniques. LoginManager() is the main class that
will handle all of this. Session protection makes sure the
user session is very secure and login_manager.login_view
Is the view that the a non-authenticated user will get redirected
to. Otherwise it is a 401 error.</p>
<h2 id="init_appapp"><code>init_app(app)</code></h2>
<pre><code class="python">mail.init_app(app)
db.init_app(app)
login_manager.init_app(app)
csrf.init_app(app)
compress.init_app(app)
RQ(app)
</code></pre>

<p>init_app(app) are methods in each of these packages
More on init_app. It binds each instance of the respective
application to the flask app. However, we do need to specify
an application context while using things like db, mail,
login_manager, and compress since they are not bound to our
application <em>exclusively</em>.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-asset-pipeline">Set up Asset Pipeline</h2>
<p>This one is a bit complex. First an Environment instance is created
that holds references to a single path to the 'static' folder. We don't
really care about that since the url_for() method allows us to specify
access to resources in the static/ directory. But we then append all the
folders and files within the 'dirs' array to the environment. This
action provides context for the subsequence set of register actions.
Looking in app/assets.py there are some Bundle instances created with
3 parameters mainly: what type of file(s) to bundle, a type of filter/
transpiler to apply, and then a final output file. E.g. for the
app_css bundle, it looks within assets/styles, assets/scripts for any
*.scss files, converts them to css with the scss transpiler and then
outputs it to the styles/app.css file.
See the templates/partials/_head.html
file for more information on how to actually include the file.</p>
<h2 id="blueprints">Blueprints</h2>
<pre><code class="python">from account import account as account_blueprint
from admin import admin as admin_blueprint
from main import main as main_blueprint

app.register_blueprint(main_blueprint)
app.register_blueprint(account_blueprint, url_prefix='/account')
app.register_blueprint(admin_blueprint, url_prefix='/admin')
</code></pre>

<p>Blueprints allow us to set up url prefixes for routes contained
within the views file of each of the divisions we specify to be
registered with a blueprint. Blueprints are meant to distinguish between
the variable different bodies within a large application.
In the case of flask-base, we have 'main', 'account', and 'admin'
sections. The 'main' section contains error handling and views.
The other sections contain mainly just views. The folders for each of
these sections also contain an <strong>init</strong> file which actually creates the
Blueprint itself with a name and a default <strong>name</strong> param as well.
After that, the views file and any other files that depend upon the
blueprint are imported and can use the variable name assigned to the
blueprint to reference things like decorators for routes. e.g. if my
blueprint is name 'first_component', I would use the following as
a decorator for my routes '@first_component.route'. By specifying
the url_prefix, all of the functions and routes etc of the blueprint
will be read with the base url_prefix specified. E.g. if I wanted
to access the '/blah' route within the 'acount' blueprint, I need only
specify @account.router('/blah') def ... as my method in views.py under
the account/ directory. But I would be able to access it in the
browser with yourdomain.com/accounts/blah</p>
<h1 id="_1"></h1>
<p>A note on why we are importing here: Because stuff will break...and for
a good reason! The account import in turn imports the views.py file under
the account/ directory. The views.py in turn references db
db is the database instance which was created after the import statements
If we had included these import statements at the very top, views.py
under account would have refered to a db instance which was not created!
hence errors...all the errors (at least in files relying upon a created
db instance...and any instance created beyond that.</p>
